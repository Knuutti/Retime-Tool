### Opening the program
- Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Knuutti/Retime-Tool/releases/latest)
- Extract the file and open the retime tool


### Using the program
You can either fill the start and end frames manually or by using the debug info from a Youtube video. When you open a Youtube video, you can move in the video frame by frame by using , and . keys. When you have found the desired frame, right click the video and select "Copy debug info". Go to the retime tool and click "Paste debug info". The program will analyze the debug info and fill the frame field. After you have filled both start and end frames, total time will update on the bottom of the window.

FPS and Modifier fields are for adjusting the total time. Changing the FPS will change how the program rounds the total time. Modifier field can be used to add/subtract certain amount of time from the total time. 

SlyGolds field below the total time will show the total time in 60 FPS standards, when seconds are rounded up to two decimals. This field can be used when submitting golds to [SlyGolds](https://slygolds.com/home).
