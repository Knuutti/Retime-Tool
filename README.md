### Opening the program
- Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Knuutti/Retime-Tool/releases/latest)
- Extract the file and open the retime tool

### Using the program
When you open a Youtube video, you can move in the video frame by frame by using , and . keys. When you have found the starting frame, right click the video and select "Copy debug info". Go to the retime tool and click "Paste start frame". Repeat the same for the end frame, and the total time will be automatically updated. If you need 2-decimal rounding, the program shows the correct rounding for both 60 fps and 30 fps videos.
